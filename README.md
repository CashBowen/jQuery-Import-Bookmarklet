# jQuery-Import-Bookmarklet
Looking to use jQuery in you bookmarklets but need jQuery imported first? We got you covered.

## Enable the Mod
Paste the code from `code.js` into the console, then type in the console:
```
window.jQuery_import();
```
Or click the bookmark which can be downloaded in the releases page.

(This is still in the testing/beta phase so it might not work!)
